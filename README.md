# Data-Analytics-project
This project is mainly based on Titanic dataset which is from kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data and then performed data analytics on the dataset.
<h3> Data Analytics mainly consists of : </h3>
1. Data observation
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualisation
4. Data Modelling

<h3>Data Observation</h3>
<h4>
  In this I used titanic dataset from kaggle and used some normal functions to see what dataset has or has not, and what do I really desire from THE DATASET as this will be very helpful, when i will start Data analysis.
</h4>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<h4>
  In this, for analyising the dataset and gaining meaningful insights from the dataset, I need to have questions. So for that I viewed myself as the user/manager of this project not as a programmer.
  At that point i knew what I want from this but as everyone knows having questions is good but having answers of them on top of in coding is slightly difficult, well unless you have revised every functions.
  See, I found many questions but i did only some because not everything is need and that some ques. were useful ones.
  They are:
</h4>

* How many siblings/spouse were on the ship
* Who was the Captain of the Ship
* Number of people who survived and died
* How many males and females were on the ship
* Number of females and males survived the incident

<h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
<h4>
  Data Visualization is necessary to indicate data in a appropriate manner and make it interactive. Visualising data makes it easy to understand to user/manager. I made some graphs that are very important in this project. 
  Graph based on:
</h4>

* boarded number of people
* survived number of people
* died number of people
* Graph of survived individuals based on gender
* Graph of survival count based on age group
* Graph of survival rate based on Passenger class

<h3>Data Modelling</h3>
<h4>
  Data modeling is a process that involves analyzing and representing data and its relationships using symbols, diagrams, and text. The goal is to create a conceptual model of how data is captured, stored, and used in a business. This process can help businesses understand their data requirements and improve software development, analytics, and business intelligence.
I processed the dataset earlier data preprocessing and then I did feature enginnering to make it easier for me to select featured columns for training data which is necessary for machine learning model.
</h4>

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<h4> Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can analyze and learn from data to make predictions and decisions. It is also a part of data analytics but it depends on you/Company  whether they(or you) wants it or not.</h4>
